# Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-spock

First game created for the BeCode JavaScript Games module.

It works like Rock-Paper-Scissors, but with 2 extra options added in the form
of Lizard and Spock.

The main function in the code is a compare function, where the 2 parameters are playerChoice and computerChoice
to simulate the possible choices randomly for the computer.

With a switch statement all possible combinations are sifted through
and given correct text messages depending on outcome.
